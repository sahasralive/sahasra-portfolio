## Current Status

- ✅ Service ID: service_kvkkg3u
- ✅ Template ID: template_te8oy1x
- ✅ Public Key: RCZKA-KIoftE32Ht4
- ❌ Getting 400 Bad Request error

## Step 1: Test Direct EmailJS (Recommended)

1. Open: http://localhost:5177/emailjs-direct-test.html
2. Fill out the form and click "Send Test Email"
3. Check browser console for detailed error information
4. This will help isolate if the issue is with React or EmailJS itself

## Step 2: Check EmailJS Dashboard

1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Login to your account
3. Check these settings:

### Service Configuration

- Go to "Email Services" → Find "service_kvkkg3u"
- Verify the service is **Active** (not suspended)
- Check that your email provider (Gmail/Outlook) is properly connected
- Verify the email address is correct

### Template Configuration

- Go to "Email Templates" → Find "template_te8oy1x"
- Verify the template is **Published** (not draft)
- Check the template uses these EXACT variables:
  ```
  {{from_name}}
  {{from_email}}
  {{message}}
  {{to_name}}
  ```

### Template Content Should Look Like:

**Subject:** New Contact Form Message from {{from_name}}

**Content:**

```
Hello {{to_name}},

You have received a new message from your portfolio contact form:

Name: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Message: {{message}}

Best regards,
Portfolio Contact Form
```

## Step 3: Test from EmailJS Dashboard

1. In your EmailJS dashboard, go to the template
2. Click "Test" button
3. Send a test email directly from the dashboard
4. If this works, the issue is in the code
5. If this fails, the issue is with the template/service

## Step 4: Check Account Limits

- Free accounts have sending limits (200 emails/month)
- Check if you've exceeded the limit
- Verify your account is not suspended

## Step 5: Common 400 Error Causes

1. **Template variables don't match** (most common)
2. **Template not published**
3. **Service not active**
4. **Rate limits exceeded**
5. **Email provider restrictions**

## Next Steps

1. Test with the direct HTML page first
2. Check the console output for specific error details
3. Verify template configuration in EmailJS dashboard
4. Test sending from the dashboard directly

The direct test page will give us the most specific error information to identify the exact issue.
